# ðŸ’¾ Installation:

> [!NOTE]
> I get installer from [gh0stzk-dotfiles](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/tree/master) & refactor files for me. The installer only works for **ARCH** Linux, and based distros.

- **Open a terminal in HOME and download the installer**
```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/master/RiceInstaller -o $HOME/RiceInstaller

# Maybe you want a short url??

curl -L https://is.gd/gh0stzk_dotfiles -o $HOME/RiceInstaller
```
- **Now give it execute permissions**
```sh
chmod +x RiceInstaller
```
- **Run the installer**
```sh
./RiceInstaller
```

- **Finally run the installer**
```sh
cp -r ./dotfiles/ ./.config/
```
